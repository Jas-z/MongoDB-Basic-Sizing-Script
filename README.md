**Basic Sizing Script**

The purpose of this script is to provide a first point of estimation for a MongoDB Atlas Cluster Sizing. The level of detail in the script will depend on the users authorization level. "Admin" users will display more information, but a "Read Only" account will be sufficient for basic sizing.

**Instructions**

1. Download and install [MongoDB Shell/Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell).
2. Connect to your cluster
3. Copy and paste the script into your session
